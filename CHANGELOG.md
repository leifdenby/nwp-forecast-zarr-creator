and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.8.0]

This release adds functionality for converting IG grib files, while still defaulting to DINI configuration if no SUITE_NAME environment variable is set.

### Added
- Added functionality for converting IG grib files to zarr. [\#32](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/32), @simonkamuk

## [v0.7.0]

This release introduces new zarr output variables (vertical velocity, orography) and a container image build workflow, while improving Docker and dev-container configurations for better maintainability.

### Added

- Added workflow for building container image and pushing to ghcr.io registry. [\#29](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/29), @khintz
- Added vertical velocity, `tw`, on pressure levels to zarr output. [\#24](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/24), @khintz
- Added orography, ´z0m´, on single levels to zarr output. [\#26](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/26), @khintz
- Added functionality to `config.py` to use functions to derive variables using functions and added extraction of orography from geopotential via this method [\#27](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/27), @khintz

### Maintenance

- adjust dev-container setup to be more general to work on more machines [\#24](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/24), @khintz
- remove redundant copy in `Dockerfile` and add cleaner `docker` commands for production build and deploy, [\#23](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/23), @leifdenby

## [v0.6.0]

This release adds support for extracting instantaneous surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, introduces a full dev-container workflow for reproducible local development, and includes an intake catalog for accessing the generated zarr datasets.

### Added

- Added extraction of instantaneous surface downwelling shortwave and surface longwave downwelling radiation fluxes as `swavr0m` and `lwavr0m` respectively. The time-step accumulated fluxes are extracted as `swavr0m_accum` and `lwavr0m_accum` to distinguish them from the instantaneous fluxes. [\#19](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/19), @leifdenby
- Added a full dev-container workflow (compose/devcontainer/docs), local GRIB download tooling, and local-development zarr options to make day-to-day development reproducible and faster.
  [\#18](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/18),
  @leifdenby
- Add intake catalog pointing to zarr datasets stored in AWS S3 bucket and usage instructions in README [\#20](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/20), @leifdenby

### Changed

- Standardized runtime path configuration and refs handling by introducing shared script defaults, renaming GRIB source/temp env vars, removing hardcoded refs paths, and enforcing a single refs timestamp directory format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMZ`).
  [\#18](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/18),
  @leifdenby

## [v0.5.4]

### Fixed

- Add missing deps to container file
  [\#17](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/17),
  @leifdenby

## [v0.5.3]
### Fixed

- Remove use of separate wheel build stage in container file to allow us to use
  `gribscan` referenced in branch on github
  [\#16](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/16),
  @leifdenby

## [v0.5.2]
### Fixed

- Add missing entrypoint and system package deps that was introduced in last release
  [\#15](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/15),
  @leifdenby

## [v0.5.1]
### Fixed

- Ensure package version is correctly resolved when running inside container
  [\#14](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/14),
  @leifdenby

## [v0.5.0]
### Added
- Keep local copy of most recent forecast in `/tmp/dini-recent`
  [\#12](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/12),
  @leifdenby
- Containerise setup so we can use `eccodes==2.42.0` with `eccodeslib` for C
  library rather than rely on system `eccodes` C lib
  [\#11](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/11), @leifdenby

---

## [v0.4.0]
### Added
- Land–sea mask extraction (`0cdf848`) and
  [\#9](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/9), @leifdenby
- Add changelog file and use dynamic versioning
  [\#9](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/9), @leifdenby
- Add wrapper for `gribscan-index` CLI to set local eccodes definitions path so
  that `gribscan` can pick up the WMO standard GRIB2 definitions that DMI uses.
  Also bundles these local definitions with the package.
  [\#9](https://github.com/dmidk/nwp-forecast-zarr-creator/pull/9), @leifdenby
